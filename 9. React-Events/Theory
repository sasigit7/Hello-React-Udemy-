:::::::::::::::::REACT EVENTS::::::::::::::

1. HANDLING EVENTS WITH REACT ELEMENTS IS VERY SIMILAR TO HANDLING 
   EVENTS ON DOM ELEMENTS. 
2. THERE ARE SOME SYNTACTIC DIFFERENCES
3. REACT EVENTS ARE NAMED USING CAMELCASE, RATHER THAN LOWERCASE.
4. WITH JSX, YOU PASS A FUNCTION AS THE EVENT HANDLER, RATHER THAN A STRING.
