                 ::::::::::::::::THIS & BIND::::::::::::::::

1. IN MOST CASES, THE VALUE OF "THIS" IS DETERMINED BY HOW A FUNCTION IS CALLED.
2. IT CAN'T BE SET BY ASSIGNMENT DURING EXECUTION, AND IT MAY BE DIFFERENT EACH
   TIME THE FUNCTION IS CALLED.
3. ES5 INTRODUCED THE BIND METHOD TO SET THE VALUE OF A FUNCTION'S "THIS"
   REGARDLESS OF HOW IT'S CALLED. 
4. BIND CREATES A NEW FUNCTION THAT WILL HAVE "THIS" SET TO THE FIRST PARAMETER
   PASSED TO bind().
